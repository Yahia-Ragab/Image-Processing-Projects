# SeqTrack: Custom Training & Evaluation on LaSOT

This repository houses a modified implementation of the [SeqTrack](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Microsoft/SeqTrack) visual tracker. It's tailored for specific training phases and a restricted evaluation on a subset of the **LaSOT** dataset ('coin' and 'mouse' classes). This work fulfills requirements for **Assignment 3 & 4**, focusing on multi-phase training, checkpoint management, and custom inference.

## 🎯 Goals

  * Train SeqTrack-B256 on a LaSOT subset.
  * **Phase 1:** Epochs 1-10.
  * **Phase 2:** Resume from Epoch 3, train to Epoch 13.
  * **Restricted Inference:** Evaluate strictly on 8 sequences: `coin-3`, `coin-6`, `coin-7`, `coin-18`, `mouse-1`, `mouse-8`, `mouse-9`, `mouse-17`.
  * Generate AUC/Precision metrics and graphs.

## 🛠️ Key Modifications

| File | Modification |
| :--- | :--- |
| `lib/test/evaluation/lasotdataset.py` | Hardcoded filter to restrict testing to the 8 target sequences. |
| `experiments/seqtrack/seqtrack_b256.yaml` | Configured for multi-phase training (custom `RESUME` paths, `EPOCH` limits). |
| `lib/train/train_script.py` | Patched `load_checkpoint` for specific paths and PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility. |
| `run_inference_phase2.sh` | Custom script for automated batch inference (Epochs 10-13) with optimized settings. |

## 🚀 Setup

```bash
conda activate seqtrack
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
```

## 🏋️‍♀️ Workflow

**Phase 1 Training (Epochs 1-9):**

```bash
python -m lib.train.run_training --script seqtrack --config seqtrack_b256 --save_dir ./phase1_checkpoints
```

**Phase 2 Training (Epochs 10-13):**
*Update `seqtrack_b256.yaml` with `TRAIN.RESUME` path before running.*

```bash
python -m lib.train.run_training --script seqtrack --config seqtrack_b256 --save_dir ./phase2_extension
```

## 🔍 Evaluation

**Run Inference:**

```bash
chmod +x run_inference_phase2.sh
./run_inference_phase2.sh
```

**Run Analysis:**

```bash
python analyze_results.py
```
